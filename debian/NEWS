ksh93 (93u+20120801-5) unstable; urgency=high

  Korn Shell: an overview over how it is packaged

  The original AT&T Korn Shell, also known as ksh93, has not seen
  development since 2013, with the last release having been published
  in 2012. There’s active development on a fork, tentatively called
  ksh2020 for its first release, which however introduces regressions,
  especially a major slowdown. (Another Korn Shell variant, mksh, is
  also packaged, but it’s a different implementation with different
  features and goals.)

  In Debian, the “ksh” package ships the “current” up-to-date version
  of the original Korn Shell lineage; for Debian buster, released in
  2019, this is ksh93; for Debian bullseye (due in 2021), this will be
  ksh2020.

  Since ksh2020 is under active development, a ksh93 package with the
  “stable” release, which however will not profit from latest improve‐
  ments, is also offered — they are coinstallable, using the alterna‐
  tives system to share /bin/{,r}ksh among all Korn Shell variants, as
  well as shcomp and their binfmt-misc registration; /etc/skel/.kshrc
  is shipped, with identical content, in both packages as well. (Note
  that neither ksh2020 nor ksh93 are currently eligible for /bin/sh
  in Debian.)

  After uninstalling ksh or ksh93 while the other was installed, run
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure on the other which will update binfmt-misc’s
  registration.
