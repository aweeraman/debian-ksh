ksh (2020.0.0+really93u+20120801-6) unstable; urgency=high

  Since the last update, the maintenance of ksh2020 has halted upstream
  with the AT&T upstream repo rolled back to the previous stable
  version of ksh93. At this point, due to the fact that there is no
  ongoing updates to ksh2020, the "ksh" package will be reverted to the
  pre-ksh2020 state with this update to ensure a stable version of ksh
  will be available in time for bullseye.

  With this update, the ksh93 package will be made redundant, and will
  be removed in due course to allow this package to be used for any
  further updates and fixes to the ksh93 lineage.

  Korn Shell: an overview over how it is packaged

  The original AT&T Korn Shell, also known as ksh93, has not seen
  development since 2013, with the last release having been published
  in 2012. There’s active development on a fork, tentatively called
  ksh2020 for its first release, which however introduces regressions,
  especially a major slowdown. (Another Korn Shell variant, mksh, is
  also packaged, but it’s a different implementation with different
  features and goals.)

  In Debian, the “ksh” package ships the “current” up-to-date version
  of the original Korn Shell lineage; for Debian buster, released in
  2019, this is ksh93; for Debian bullseye (due in 2021), this will be
  ksh2020.

  Since ksh2020 is under active development, a ksh93 package with the
  “stable” release, which however will not profit from latest improve‐
  ments, is also offered — they are coïnstallable, using the alterna‐
  tives system to share /bin/{,r}ksh among all Korn Shell variants, as
  well as shcomp and their binfmt-misc registration; /etc/skel/.kshrc
  is shipped, with identical content, in both packages as well. (Note
  that neither ksh2020 nor ksh93 are currently eligible for /bin/sh
  in Debian.)

  After uninstalling ksh or ksh93 while the other was installed, run
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure on the other which will update binfmt-misc’s
  registration.
