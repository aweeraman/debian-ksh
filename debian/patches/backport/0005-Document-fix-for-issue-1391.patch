 ## Other significant changes
 
+- Using a bare tilde (e.g., `cd ~`) now works correctly if `$HOME` is not set
+  (issue #1391).
 - You can no longer run an external command with stdin, stdout, or stderr
   closed. If you attempt to do so (e.g., `a_cmd <&-`) it will be opened on
   /dev/null in the child process (issue #1117).
